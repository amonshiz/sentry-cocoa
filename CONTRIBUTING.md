# Contributing

We welcome suggested improvements and bug fixes for `sentry-cocoa`, in the form of pull requests. To get early feedback, we recommend opening up a [draft PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests). Please follow our official [Commit Guidelines](https://develop.sentry.dev/code-review/#commit-guidelines) and also prefix the title of your PR according to the [Commit Guidelines](https://develop.sentry.dev/code-review/#commit-guidelines). The guide below will help you get started, but if you have further questions, please feel free to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ww9hbqr).

For feedback in PRs, we use the [LOGAF scale](https://blog.danlew.net/2020/04/15/the-logaf-scale/) to specify how important a comment is:

* `l`: low - nitpick. You may address this comment, but you don't have to.
* `m`: medium - normal comment. Worth adressing and fixing.
* `h`: high - Very important. We must not merge this PR without adressing this issue.

See [develop-docs/README.md](develop-docs/README.md) for more technical information on developing the SDK. 

## Final Notes

When contributing to the codebase, please make note of the following:
